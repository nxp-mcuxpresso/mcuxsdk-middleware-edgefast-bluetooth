# Introduction

NXP supports Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy on RT1060EVK and RT1060EVKC. RT1064 has the same MCU die with RT1060EVK and RT1060EVKC and therefore it is possible to migrate the examples.

This document takes *peripheral\_ht* as an example and describes the steps to migrate EdgeFast examples from RT1060EVK to RT1064 \(based on SDK 2.13.0\) and from RT1060EVKC to RT1064 \(based on SDK 2.14.0\) with different toolchains including IAR, Arm GCC, and MDK.
