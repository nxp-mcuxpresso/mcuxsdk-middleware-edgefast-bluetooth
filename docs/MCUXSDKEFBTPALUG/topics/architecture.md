# Architecture

The figure Architecture of EdgeFast Bluetooth Protocol Abstraction Layer demo in MCUXpresso SDK below shows that the EdgeFast Bluetooth Protocol Abstraction Layer host stack is integrated into the MCUXpresso SDK as a middleware component. It leverages the RTOS, the board support, the peripheral driver/component, and other components in the MCUXpresso SDK. The Bluetooth application is built on top of the EdgeFast Bluetooth Protocol Abstraction Layer host stack and supports different peripheral features, Bluetooth features, and different RTOSes required by the user.

MCUXpresso SDK has the dual-chip architecture defined by EdgeFast Bluetooth Protocol Abstraction Layer project, the Bluetooth application code, and the EdgeFast Bluetooth Protocol Abstraction Layer host stack running on the reference board. For example, MIMXRT1060-EVK and the Linker Layer \(LL\) run on the Bluetooth modules like AW-AM457-USD, Murata Type 1XK, and Murata Type 1ZM and has single-chip architecture. Bluetooth Host stack and LL runs on the same chip, and communicate with Internal Communication Unit \(IMU\).

The communication between the host stack and the LL is implemented via the standard HCI UART interface and PCM interface for voice, or the IMU interface.

For details on possible hardware rework requirements, see the hardware rework guide document of the relative board.
