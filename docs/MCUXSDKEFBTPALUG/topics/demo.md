# Demo

This topic lists the steps to run a demo application using IAR, steps to run a demo application using MCUXpresso IDE, and steps to download LL firmware from the reference board. The following chapter uses RT1060 and peripheral\_ht as an example.

Before you run the example, see the readme.txt in current the peripheral\_ht directory and the Hardware Rework Guide for EdgeFast BT PAL document to set the jumper and connect the wireless module with development board.

The uSD type wireless module is similar to the Development board connector in the Run an IAR example section. If the module is M2 type, connect the module to the onboard M2 interface.
