# Hardware Rework Guide for MIMXRT1060-EVKC and Murata 2EL M.2 Adapter 

This section is a brief hardware rework guidance of the EdgeFast Bluetooth PAL on the NXP i.MX MIMXRT1060-EVKC and the Murata 2EL M.2 solution - direct M.2 connection to Embedded Artistsâ€™ Rev-A1 \(2EL\) M.2 modules.

The hardware rework has three parts:

-   HCI UART rework
-   PCM interface rework
-   LE Audio Synchronization interface rework \(only used on sink side\)
